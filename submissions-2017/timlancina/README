### MDTToken

The most heralded ICO of the year!

Some features of the contract:
 - Uncapped token supply
 - Tokens are created 1:1 with Ether sent to the contract
 - Ether is burned!
 - Ends after ~30 days
 - 1 million MDT are reserved for the owner (me) and any investors

The distribution scheme is as follows:
  The owner is entitled to 20% of the reserved MDT, and the investors split the
  remaining 80% (between however many investors there are).
  However, after the offering period has ended, there is a one year penalty
  period. If the owner withdraws their portion of the reserve before the one
  year is up, they receive a portion of their 20% equal to the percentage of
  the year that has elapsed so far. So if only 6 months have gone by, the owner
  receives 10%, and the investors split ithe remaining 90%.
  Another caveat is that investors cannot withdraw *their* MDT until after the
  owner has withdrawn his/hers.

The sneakiness is that payoutPercent is redeclared locally at the bottom of the
withdrawMDT function, so when the owner goes to withdraw funds early, the
payoutPercentage underflows (because it's actually 0) and instead of having their
balance credited with some portion of the fund, they receive something close to
MAX_INT. Hello Shittoken!

Thanks for doing this contest! This was my first contract ever and I learned
a ton about Solidity and developing contracts in the process.
