Short explanation:

I want to sell magicBeans which after planted create tress on which money grows.
In order to pay for the research to check whether this is feasible, I need at least 100.000 ETH.

Everyone can buy a virtual magicBean for one wei per piece during the time of the funding period. In case the funding goal 
of 100.000 ETH is not reached, everbody can get there ETH back. In this case I get nothing. I promise. I really do.

For security reasons I even added an invariant check to make sure the number of virtual magic beans is always the same as the number of wei in the contract.
Nothing can go wrong with that.
