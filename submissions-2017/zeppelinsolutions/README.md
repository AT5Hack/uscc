## Explanation

This attack is possible in most crowdsales found in the wild.

Crowdsale owners can buy tokens with the fund collection wallet funds and gain tokens unfairly.

See `test/MerdeCrowdsale.js` test case 'should allow developer to get free tokens' for an example on the attack.

```
npm install
npm test
```
